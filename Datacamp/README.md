### 1. Introduction to Tableau

I learned how to navigate Tableauâ€™s interface and connect and present data using easy-to-understand visualizations by exploring Tableau and build impactful data dashboards.

### 2. Analyzing Data in Tableau

In this course, I learned how to create detail-rich map visualizations, configure date and time fields to show trends over time, and extend data using Calculated Fields. 
Through hands-on activities,  I learned how to create bins, customize filters and interactions, and apply quick table calculations. 
Finally, I've learned power user techniques, including how to slice and dice data and apply dynamic sets and groups.

### 3. Creating Dashboards in Tableau

Dashboards are a must-have tool in todayâ€™s data-driven world. By combining curated data visualizations, dashboards allow users to interpret and ask their own questions of data. By reducing the time to insight and empowering business analysts, dashboards can have a big impact on business performance.
Tableau's dashboarding abilities are powerful and easy to use. In this course, I learned to apply dashboard-composition best practices, add interactive or explanatory elements, and use dashboard actions to make your dashboard interactive. Additionally, I learned to modify an existing dashboard layout for mobile devices to share as an image or a PDF. Finally, I learned how to share your data story through Tableau's story functionality.

### 4. Connecting Data in Tableau

Great analysis begins with great data. In this course, I learned how to use connectors in Tableau to create a live connection to CSV and Excel files. Through hands-on exercises, I also learned how to combine multiple data tables with joins, unions, and relationships. Finally, I learned to manage different data properties, like renaming data fields, assigning aliases, changing data types, and changing default properties for a data field.
