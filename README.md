# Tableau

I've learned how to use Tableau—one of the world’s most popular business intelligence tools. 
With its user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality it can be used by everyone to quickly clean, analyze, and visualize data.
Through hands-on exercises, I've learned how to organize and analyze data, create presentation-ready visualizations, build insightful dashboards, and apply analytics to worksheets.
